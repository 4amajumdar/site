    <h1>Help for Family Tree</h1>
    <br />
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This is a simple free app to view family trees. &nbsp;The input is a
      comma-separated file (as described later) and the output is an interactive
      family tree.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Input file</h2>
    <p>
      The input is a csv (comma-separated file) with the multiple rows. A csv file can be easily created using a spreadsheet app and saving the file as csv.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each individual or union is recoded in a separate row. The row can have one or two
      individuals as describes below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An individual will have a name and one or many options in brackets. The
        name can be words separated by space.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each option is a key followed by space followed by a word:
        <ul>
          <li>
            key = <c>aka</c> followed by a word (other name); aka stands for
            also known as.
          </li>
          <li>
            key = <c>gender</c> followed by f or m for female and male
            respectively. If no gender is provided male is assumed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If there is a spouse, then it is recorded with a + sign. Examples in
        table below.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a spouse is present, best practice suggests that the first
        individual must be the direct descendant of the family.
      </li>
      <table>
        <p>Examples of individuals, unions and options</p>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Written as</th>
            <th>Means</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td><c>xxx (gender f)</c></td>
            <td>Individual with name = xxx, gender = female</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><c>xxx xyz(gender m)</c></td>
            <td>
              Individual with name = xxx xyz, gender = male. If no gender is
              provided it defaults to male
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><c>xxx</c></td>
            <td>Individual with name = xxx, gender = male</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><c>xxx (aka yyy)</c></td>
            <td>Individual with name = xxx, aka = yyy, gender = male</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><c>xxx (aka yyy gender f)</c></td>
            <td>Individual with name = xxx, aka = yyy, gender = female</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><c>xxx (gender f aka yyy)</c></td>
            <td>Individual with name = xxx, aka = yyy, gender = female</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td><c>xxx xyz + yyy (gender f)</c></td>
            <td>
              Direct descendant's name = xxx xyz, gender = male and spouse with
              name = yyy, gender = female
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><c>xxx (gender f) + yyy (aka zzz)</c></td>
            <td>
              Direct descendant's name = xxx, gender = female and spouse with
              name = yyy, aka = zzz, gender = male
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <br />
    </ul>

    <p>
      If the first letter in the first column of a row is a # it means it is a
      directive to the app rather than an individual of union. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <c>#title</c> means app will display the title with the words following
        the directive. if is not provided the app uses the first descendant's
        name as default.
      </li>
      <li>
        <c>#note</c> means the app will display note with the words following
        the directive. Multiple notes are allowed
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first individual or union from the first generation is written in column 1. The
      children are written in rows below the parents, one row for a child, and
      in column N+1 where the parents are in column N. Best practice suggests
      that childen are recorded oldest child is one the very next row after
      parents.
    </p>
