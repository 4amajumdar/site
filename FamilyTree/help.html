    <h1>Help for Family Tree</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This is a simple free app to view family trees. &nbsp;The input is a
      comma-separated file (as described later) and the output is an interactive
      family tree.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <h2>Input file</h2>
    <p>The input is a csv (comma-separated file) with the following field:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each union is recoded in a separate row. A union can have one or two
        individuals as describes below.
        <ul>
          <li>
            An individual will have a name and one or many options in brackets.
            The name can be words separated by space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each option is a key followed by space followed by a word:
            <ul>
              <li>
                key = <c>aka</c> followed by a word (other name); aka stands for
                also known as.
              </li>
              <li>
                key = <c>gender</c> followed by f or m for female and male
                respectively. If no gender is provided male is assumed
              </li>
              <li>Examples in table below</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If there is a spouse, then it is recorded with a + sign. Examples in
            table below.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a spouse is present, best practice suggests that the first individual must be the direct
            descendant of the family.
          </li>
          <br />

        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>The first union from the first generation is written in column 1.</li>
      <li>
        The children are written in rows below the parents, one row for a child, and in column N+1
        where the parents are in column N. Best practice suggests that childen are recorded oldest child is one the very next row after parents.
      </li>
      <li>
        If in a row the first letter in the first column is a # it means it is a
        directive to the app.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <c>#title</c> means app will display the title with the words
          following the directive. if is not provided the app uses the first
          descendant's name as default.
        </li>
        <li>
          <c>#note</c> means the app will display note with the words following
          the directive. Multiple notes are allowed
        </li>
